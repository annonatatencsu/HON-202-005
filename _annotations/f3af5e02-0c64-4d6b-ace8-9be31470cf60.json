The shot panning out from the window is so familiar to us; we've all been there, sitting by the window as life goes on around us. This time, though, it doesn't pan out to an American townhouse or skyscraper. Instead, we see a massive, inscribed monolith with no apparent symmetry or structure. We can connect with the protagonist not on the broad structure of society, but on the most intimate minutiae of daily life and experience.",
